My name is Christopher Mertin and this is my page on both my projects and
topics in Machine Learning.

I graduated from Florida State University in 2010 with a dual Bachelor's in
Physics and Applied Mathematics. I'm currently attending the University of Utah
where I'm pursuing a Master's in Data Management and Analytics.

This page is to showcase various problems and projects that I've undertaken,
as well as be a tool for people to learn about aspects of Machine Learning.
